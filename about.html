        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Religious practices help Cybersecurity Incident Responders cope with trauma developed within the profession. This website aims to provide support by sharing faith-based strategies, reflective insights, and personal stories of healing through the lens of theology.</p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity professionals operate in high-stress environments—responding to breaches, managing digital threats, 
            and carrying the burden of protecting others' privacy and safety. The emotional impact of this work can be severe, 
            often leading to burnout, anxiety, or trauma. By integrating theology, we introduce a path toward recovery rooted in purpose, community, and moral clarity.</p>

                    <h2>Believing</h2>
                    <p>Believing is the foundation of both spiritual resilience and secure behavior. 
                    Just as faith traditions center on belief in protection, grace, and moral clarity, cybersecurity professionals 
                    often rely on core convictions to make ethical decisions under pressure. In trauma recovery, belief in a higher 
                    purpose, or simply belief that healing is possible, becomes the first step in rebuilding emotional and 
                    psychological stability.</p>
                    <p>Encouraging reflection, prayer, and positive internal messaging (as seen in theology and training alike) can 
                    renew hope and ground responders in their purpose when the work becomes overwhelming.</p>

                    <h2>Belonging</h2>
                    <p>Belonging reflects the human need for support, fellowship, and trust. This is a key value in both 
                    spiritual communities and cybersecurity teams. Theology teaches us that we are not meant to carry burdens alone; 
                    likewise, trauma recovery thrives in spaces where professionals feel heard, understood, and valued.</p>
                    <p>Joining faith groups, peer support spaces, or simply having a trusted circle at work can ease isolation, 
                    encourage vulnerability, and offer wisdom that leads to healing. Proverbs reminds us: "As iron sharpens iron, 
                    so one person sharpens another."</p>

                    <h2>Doing</h2>
                    <p>Doing is the practice of living out the belief with your belonging, through ritual, service, and 
                    ethical behavior. In theology, we’re called to forgive, lead by example, and serve others. In cybersecurity, 
                    we act by mentoring teammates, enforcing just policies, or responding to crises with compassion and integrity.</p>
                    <p>Trauma recovery isn’t passive. Healing grows through action: establishing routines, helping others, or 
                    engaging in practices that restore trust and meaning. Doing honors our beliefs and strengthens the communities 
                    we belong to both spiritually and professionally. </p>

        <p>Together, these three dimensions—Believing, Belonging, and Doing—create a holistic model of recovery rooted in both theology and lived experience. Our goal is to help responders move from surviving trauma to growing through it.</p>
