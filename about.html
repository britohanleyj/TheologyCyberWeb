        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Religious practices help Cybersecurity Incident Responders cope with trauma developed within the profession. This website aims to provide support by sharing faith-based strategies and personal stories of healing.</p>
        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity responders face constant threats, long hours, and emotional strain. The integration of theology offers a unique approach to healing by
           making connections between the two discipline through belonging, believing, and doing.</p>
